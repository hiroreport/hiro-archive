      "description": "This is a surprisingly heartfelt and delightful app. The premise is simple: Every day you get a prompt with a thoughtful question to answer. Once you've answered it, you will receive someone else's answer to the question from the day before. It's totally anonymous apart from getting to see what country the respondent is from, and they can choose whether or not to share their age and gender info. It's just a sweet way to learn more about other people and cultures, in a lovely app design.",

It's a neat concept executed in a fun retro JRPG art style. Well worth it if you're wanting to experiment with limiting your access to social media, etc., on your phone. (Thanks for the tip, Jay!)",

You can tweak the categories, or make your own, and then build budgets for how much you want to spend in each bucket each month, easily getting alerts when you're getting close to your spending cap, etc. It looks great, works great, and has killer customer service.

You get up to four channels to use built-in synthesizers to create your own catchy loops and beats. I'm a sucker for any small, good-looking, pocketable devices with buttons and lights on them. Bonus points for it making really fun sounds, being USB-C powered, and having over 30 hours of battery life and multiple years of standby battery life.",

After downloading half a dozen or so, this is the one I'm sticking with for the next few weeks/months. In short, apps like this help you keep track of whether or not you've completed some habit you're trying to build, or if you've successfully avoided some unproductive habit you're trying to quit. You simply mark in the app that you've done (or not done) the thing that day, and then it presents you a nice chart of your progress. HabitKit is simple but with a lot of deeper features if you want them, and best of all it looks nice. As nice as it is, there's no way I'm going to be able to stick to my resolution this year.",

It's designed to capture your fleeting thoughts via a built-in button and microphone. The ring's software is customizable, so you can ostensibly configure it to handle other tasks as well. The big catch? It's not rechargeable. You'll get about two years of use, and then you send it back to be recycled. It also doesn't offer any of the usual health tracking features you expect from smart rings. Personally, I'd have a hard time justifying grabbing one, but it's neat to see experimentation in this space—and who knows? Maybe we were given ten fingers so we can rock a constellation of smart rings?",

It ALSO lets you apply custom LUTs to both photos and videos, shoot in Apple Log 2, offers open gate and even anamorphic desqueezing in case you picked up an anamorphic lens for your iPhone. Best of all, it's a one-time purchase and they have a full roadmap for making the app even better in the months ahead.",

      "description": "The folks at Outin have just launched a new, even smaller, portable, powered espresso machine for travel and camping. They have very kindly sent me one to review in the coming days, so I’ll have more thoughts soon, but first impressions based off the specs alone are positive—It’s more compact than their Nano that I used and really enjoyed on a recent trip, but claims to heat your water both hotter and faster while also including a more powerful pump for your ’spro. It looks like a winner.",

      "description": "Let me preface this by acknowledging that the price point on this thing is ridiculous, but it’s a really fantastic light. It’s about half the size of a thick pen, but kicks out a whole lot of high‑quality (90+ CRI) light. With the optional clip, it clips nicely into jean pockets or backpacks, but with the default magnetic keyring, you get some magic—When you tug the flashlight off the magnetic keyring, it automatically turns on, and then turns itself back off when you reattach it. Super satisfying. I’ve had mine for a few years now, and it’s one of my favorite fall and winter EDC items as the days get shorter.",

With version 3.0, the AI gets a serious power-up: it can now handle agentic tasks inside Notion and across popular web services, meaning it can actually help you knock things off your to-do list.

The side-by-side comparison photos are pretty startling... As someone who loves AstroPad's Rock Paper Pencil paper-like iPad screen protector and pencil combo, I'd be all over this screen protector if there weren't rumors that the iPhone 17 Pro will have similar tech built into its display. We'll find out this week.",

Over the last month, I've been gradually switching all the troublesome lights over to these cheap smart switches from Kasa and have been very happy with them.

For those not familiar, the Weiss Distribution Technique (WDT) is a method of using small, very fine needles to break up the clumps in your coffee grinds to improve their consistency and distribution for a more even and better-balanced espresso shot. There are a lot of different tools out there, but this one uses a whole system of springs and gears to thoroughly mix your grinds and leaves them looking smooth and fluffy, ready for tamping. It gets bonus points for looking and feeling like a steampunk coffee accessory.",

The reality is I pull my phone out of my pocket often throughout the day just to take a peek at something and then find myself 5 minutes deep into a social media scroll or work email exchange. One week with the Brick and I'm becoming way more aware of just how often that muscle memory kicks in. When you set it up, you select all the apps that you'd like to lock away (for me it's basically social media + work apps) and either set a schedule of when you want them to be locked (like in the evening when I'm playing with my family), or you can just selectively lock them when you want to focus (like during your morning routine). When you want to \"unlock\" these apps, you have to physically walk over to wherever you keep your Brick and tap the phone to the NFC chip inside.",

It took 10 minutes just to figure out which fire alarm it was. I was fed up, and decided to go shopping. I wanted to get a \"smart\" alarm so that I could get notified of low battery on my phone rather than via chirping in the middle of the night, and I also wanted to be notified if an alarm is going off when I'm not home. The X-Sense checks all those boxes for way less than the now discontinued Nest Protect smoke alarms. Set-up was super quick and easy, and so far no false alarms!",

It is a small puck-shaped power plug, no larger than an AirPods Pro case, that plugs into any power outlet and has a MagSafe-friendly charger right on the back of it. No need for cables or a fancy docking station. You can just attach your phone right to the plug. That said, it does have a discreet USB-C PD port that can deliver up to 35W of fast charging for other, non-MagSafe devices. I plan to grab one of these and use it in my kitchen.",

So, with that all said, I'm really intrigued by the beautiful new titanium-bodied GMT watch that they just launched this week. It features a beautiful double-domed sapphire crystal with an anti-reflective coating over a bright, good-looking full dial lume. For those not familiar, a GMT watch features an additional hour hand that you can set to keep track of time in a different time zone by pairing it with the 24-hour bezel on the face of the watch. It's a handy feature for travelers, and also just a super fun complication to add to mechanical watches. They're limiting it to just 300 pieces and plan to ship to backers next month.",

The FP2 uses mmWave radar to detect up to 5 people's movement in a space. You can also define zones within a space so that it can trigger distinct automations based off presence in specific parts of a room— i.e. When someone sits on the couch, turn on the lamp.

The MeshPocket is a new Meshtastic-powered Qi2 battery pack that attaches to your phone for wireless charging but also comes equipped with Bluetooth and a built-in LoRa wireless communication antenna and an e-ink display for showing signal status, messages, and more. The whole thing is hackable for devising your own specialized applications as well, so it's not just limited to Meshtastic.",

This was an instant buy for me, as we're constantly needing to clean up dried mud, goldfish crackers, and other small things from our car mats. I also like that the blower is strong enough to blow leaves off your windshield wipers, another regular annoyance once we head into fall/winter.",

      "description": "I've happily used Day One for my digital journaling for years, but I've been feeling the itch lately to try something different. Diarly offers many of the same great features like multimedia journaling (include voice recordings, drawings, and photos), encrypted back-ups, custom and pre-made journaling templates, and so on. Where Diarly stands out for me is that it lets you sync your journal between your Mac/iPad/iPhone using an encrypted vault in your iCloud files, rather than requiring you to use their own proprietary sync servers. Beyond that, I appreciate that it gives you a little more customization over the look and feel of your journals. They're also being forward-leaning about letting you have the option of incorporating AI in your journaling for running queries, getting writing help, etc. It's only been a few weeks but I'm enjoying it.",

My only complaint is that you only get a small handful of test shots before they push you right into a $15/year subscription.

However, I crumbled a few weeks back, and it’s quickly become one of my favorite iPhone accessories. I’m using it every day for everything from propping up my phone on my desk while I work, to using it as a tripod to take group photos, and as a way to more easily display my Ladder workouts when I’m in the gym. I previously used and loved the Peak Design MagSafe tripod, but this is just so much easier and versatile (not to mention half the price)… there’s no way I’m going back.",

I’m excited to try out Alma because it seems committed to making the logging and entry process as effortless as possible. It does this by leveraging AI to let you either dictate with your voice a description of what you ate or snap a picture, which the AI then analyzes to give its best guess at the nutrients, calories, etc. It also has a built-in AI-powered nutrition coach where you can ask questions to help you make more informed decisions before eating things.

For those who may not be camera nerds, ND filters attach over a lens to cut the amount of light passing through—much like sunglasses do. The difference here is that adjustable ND filters let you twist the filter to either increase or decrease the amount of light passing through. As a result, these sunglasses let you manually adjust how bright or dark you want a scene to be. If you are out in the Atacama Desert on a sunny day, you probably want to dial those things in. On the other hand, if you’re out on a cloudy day in the Irish countryside, you probably would want to let more light in. I need a pair.",

In short, it solves the problem of saving Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok videos that have practical information in them but that you never get around to extracting. For example, my algorithms know I like food so I get a lot of Reels about new restaurants and recipes I want to check out, but it's kind of a pain in the butt to actually write down the recipe or the address of the new restaurant in the moment. With Sortd, you just share these videos to the app, and it \"sorts\" all your saved videos into different categories (e.g. Restaurants, Recipes, Products, Books, et al), uses AI to extract the practical information and then gives you links to go find the restaurant in the Maps app, go buy the book online, or simply read the recipe without having to squint at the small caption text. It's got a great, friendly design, and is made by a hard working indie dev. Go check it out.",

I, for one, am using it to customize my Logi MX Master 3S* without having to use the bloated Logi app.",

      "description": "Fuji is back to making weird little cameras, and I love it. This week they released the Fuji X-Half, a little camera designed to get you as close as possible to the experience of shooting an analog half frame film camera in a digital camera. The camera shoots vertically oriented 3:4 photos by default and even has a thumb wind \"film advance\" lever. One of my favorite things is that you put in virtual rolls of film, wherein you choose what sort of film simulation you want to use, how many frames you want to be on it, and then you shoot away through the optical viewfinder until you finish the roll—only then can you see what you actually captured. The camera will even save a virtual contact sheet that shows you all 36-72 photos in one image, in addition to each individual frame. There's a lot more fun stuff this camera can do that makes it seem like it would be a blast. I love seeing Fuji experiment like this.",

The Capture is a stackable, modular system for capturing and filing handwritten notes at your desk, building off his excellent Analog Productivity System, with which this new system is also compatible. The new system provides a tray for holding your 3x5in Analog to-do cards, and adds a new, larger tray and premium stock 5x6.5in Capture Card for long-form notes. I particularly like the addition of a small flap at the bottom of the trays to make it easier to slide used cards into the bottom of the stack (something I've struggled with on my wooden Analog tray).",

This new set is for assembling and disassembling smaller items and electronics, compared to the other set that's more for furniture. Like the older set, this one comes with a nice storage case for all 56 bits... However, unlike the boring grey of the original, this one has a cool pop of color and uses magnets so you can modularly stack it with their other new tool sets. The electric driver supports three speeds with built-in smarts to prevent over-torquing micro screws on your glasses, phone, laptop, etc.",

But what do we do with older tech that we want to automate that doesn't connect to the web? Well, this humble Smart Switch aims to help answer that dilemma. In short, it's a little physical flipper that you can attach to any device with a button or toggle that you'd like to be able to flip remotely. The flipper can be activated over Bluetooth out of the box, or with a SwitchBot hub, you can control it with Apple HomeKit / Alexa / Google Home.

It runs in the background on your Mac and records both sides of virtual meetings, but cleverly also presents a notepad on screen that you can take notes in during the call. Once the call is over, it combines the transcript of the call with your notes to give you a nicely organized meeting summary. You can use their default templates, or create your own prompts for how you'd like the AI summary to be formatted, what it should focus on, etc. I like that it doesn't require having a weird bot dial in to your call, it just runs locally on your Mac. Handily, Granola also just released an iPhone app this week. It can't record calls yet, but it can be used for recording and generating notes for in-person meetings.",

It's small enough and hardy enough to really be able to lug it everywhere. That said, there are times where I don't want to worry about it flopping around my neck, or when I want to bring a spare lens or two, so I started looking for a really small everyday carry bag I could use for my outings. After trying a bunch of options, I've settled on this awesome 5L camera sling Peter McKinnon made in collaboration with Nomatic. It's got a customizable internal padded section for a camera and a lens or two, as well as small pockets for SD cards and batteries, while still leaving just enough room for me to throw in a wallet and sunglasses, or notebook and pen. I particularly like the structured outer shell that zips completely open for visibility and easy access to the camera compartment. The sling works great both as a shoulder bag and as a fanny pack, and doesn't scream \"I've got a fancy camera in here.\" I dig it.",

What they did bring over was their clean, minimalist, Markdown-powered, synced notes capability, quick access to all of the major LLMs via both their voice and chat AI interfaces, and access to your synced text snippets and quick links from your Mac. It's clear this is a first step towards something larger, however, and Raycast has already acknowledged they are working on developing an iOS keyboard so you can access more of this functionality in-line while writing on the iPhone and iPad. That said, Parker Ortolani has already written about the possibilities for using quick links and shortcuts to use Raycast for iOS as a modern day replacement for the vaunted Launch Center Pro.

Simply choose what you want to do, Lume will crunch the weather data, and return a time window along with an explanation of why that's the optimal time.",

      "description": "- The wizards over at 12South recently released an update to their awesome AirFly dongle which lets you turn any headphone auxiliary jack into an audio device to which you can connect your AirPods or other Bluetooth headphones. Although originally designed for use on planes to be able to use your own wireless headphones to watch inflight movies, I find it useful for using my AirPods with retro gaming handhelds during late night gaming sessions when I want to listen to the chip tunes without disturbing my partner. This new version now has buttons to make it easier to pair up to two sets of headphones simultaneously without needing to use a splitter.",

It strikes a great balance between a compact, Gameboy-style form factor and more comfortable ergonomics with better materials than the Miyoo Mini+ I also own. It comes preloaded with a couple thousand retro games from Atari, Nintendo, and on up to the PlayStation 1. But what really sold me is the ability to install and run PakUI, a custom OS featuring BitPal—a fun digital pet system that has you level it up by playing assigned games from your library. Anyone who’s used one of these systems knows how paralyzing the sheer volume of options can be—I’ve spent entire “gaming sessions” just flipping through titles without actually playing. BitPal seems like a fun way to discover new games and also commit to actually playing them. The PakUI install is a bit of a technical lift, but manageable if you’ve ever set up a Raspberry Pi or similar project.",

Beyond giving you manual shooting controls and the option to shoot in ProRAW, the app has an \"Aperture Priority\" mode where you can choose from several classic Leica lenses, pick the aperture you want to shoot at, and it outputs photos with simulated bokeh / lens blur effects characteristic of each of the lenses. The effect is much better than I expected, even capturing the swirly bokeh effect of some vintage Leica lenses. The app is pricey at $70(!)/year, but they have a free trial that lets you shoot up to 38 photos at no cost if you just want to give it a spin.",

It's early days still, but I'm loving it— It has an internal battery so it can be installed anywhere OR hardwired in to your existing doorbell with the battery as fallback in the event of blackouts, it also records and AI processes all video locally without sending anything to the cloud (unless you specifically turn on cloud back-ups) but it's still accessible for remote viewing via an end-to-end encrypted connection between your smart phone and the device. I find the video quality to be excellent and I appreciate that it has two cameras— one for showing you visitors as they approach, and one pointed down to show you packages and pets at your door. Caveat: Three years back, it was discovered that eufy was not encrypting its web streaming video feeds (while claiming they were), leading to a major showdown with The Verge. They have since gone to great lengths to amend, have brought in auditors, started a bug bounty program, and have doubled down on making everything local by default. I’m comfortable giving them a try now, but everyone should make their own considerations. *This is not sponsored, but I am using an Amazon Affiliate Link to support the site at no additional cost to you.",

      "description": "I feel kind of bad for linking to this pen because it's basically impossible to get. It just launched a few weeks back in Japan, and it's sold out across the country. The only US retailer I could find that carries it (linked) is also sold out. The Zento Signature is a premium-ish (~$30) version of Uniball's new Zento line of ink/pens. They reportedly spent 5 years developing this luscious water-based gel ink that writes ridiculously smoothly while also drying quickly without bleeding/feathering. The Signature version comes with a cool metallic body design and a satisfying magnetic click when posting the cap. If, like me, you can't wait to get your hands on the Signature version to try out Zento, you can grab a two pack of the standard Zento pens* for cheap— I just got some and love how they write.",

My brilliant wife had the idea of getting some indoor air quality detectors to check out what's going on. We wound up getting this Govee PM2.5 monitor* to measure ultra fine particulates in the air and the Aranet4 CO2 detector to measure Carbon Dioxide. I'll spare you all of the sordid findings (although I will say they were shocking), but I've been super impressed with the Aranet4 in particular. It is pricey but is apparently very highly regarded and was effortless to set up. I particularly like the super legible e-ink display.",

I've been using it for journaling, capturing ideas, making lists, and more. I cannot emphasize enough just how much better the transcription is in Stardate compared to Siri's transcription. In my early testing, the quality of transcription is on par with the also excellent Voicenotes app, however I really like that Stardate does not send your recordings off to a third-party AI service and everything is stored in your own iCloud Drive account. In fact, nothing leaves your device unless you choose to share the recording or the transcription with some other app or service.

At the risk of oversharing, I had some gross dust and schmutz building up between the shutter and exposure comp dials that I just couldn’t blow off* or swab away with Q-tips. A frustrated bout of web searching led me to this kit from K&F Concept, and it’s exactly what I needed. Three minutes with the combination of a bulb blower, soft brush, and smudge remover, and my two main camera bodies are looking nearly brand new.",

Someday I might write out my full list, but I’ll skip straight to #1 with a bullet here—Raycast. It’s become so essential to many of my workflows for how I use my computer. In short, it’s a quick “everything bar” for your computer—sort of what Apple’s Spotlight is supposed to be but never quite delivers on. Raycast lets you search your computer, convert currency or units, do an AI query, queue up some music, and more, thanks to an extensive free shop of community-built plugins.",

It also supports back-linking to other notes within the app. While it’s not as powerful (or complex) as something like Obsidian or Notion, it is aces for my own informal zettelkasten / PKM efforts to track books I’m reading, my favorite things I’ve ordered at various restaurants, movies I want to watch, and so on.",

Best of all, you can send older models in and, for a fee, they will upgrade your components (new sensors, new processors, etc) as they are released. So, for example, there are folks who bought the original Pixii 5 years ago with an APSC sensor, that are sending their cameras in to be upgraded this month to the new full frame sensor. How cool is that? That said, it does have some limitations that keep it from really being a fit for me (no mechanical shutter being a big one in my mind), BUT I’m really rooting for these guys and would love to see them bring some more competition to keep Leica on its toes.",

The new version looks like another fantastic iteration. It’s super helpful for figuring out which app is causing your fan to spin up or quickly checking if you have enough space to download that movie for a flight. You can buy it directly from Bjango or get it as part of SetApp’s subscription catalog of Mac and iOS apps.",

It has a clean, minimal design that effortlessly syncs your writing across its Mac, iOS, and iPad apps. It also handily supports back-linking to other notes within the app. While it’s not as powerful as Obsidian or Notion, it excels for my informal zettelkasten / PKM method for keeping notes on books, my favorite things to order at various restaurants, my friendly mechanic’s name and backstory, etc. Easy to write and easy to reference— In fact, I draft all my weekly Hiro Reports in Bear.",

The editorial focus was on self-sufficiency, ecology, alternative education, ‘do it yourself,’ and holism, featuring the slogan ‘access to tools.’” This archive is a treasure trove—vintage tech, original R.

Pop them into hot water, and you’re drinking coffee as if it were brewed fresh by a barista at home. I was dubious butmy first box has really impressed me. The coffee is much more flavorful than what I can make with my setup. [Disclosure: The link above will get you 20 free cups of coffee and supports my coffee intake.

      "description": "Apple held their Worldwide Developer’s Conference (WWDC) this week and shared previews of all the exciting new features coming to the next versions of their software platforms. While they revealed lots of fun, the star of the show was their unveiling of “Apple Intelligence,” a privacy-first AI integration throughout their operating systems. I’ll have more to say about that once I’ve tried it out when it’s released to beta testers later this summer. For now, I’m enjoying the early beta updates for the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. The above linked article is a fun summary from The Verge on all the neat little things Apple is bringing to the next OS updates that weren’t mentioned in the keynote. If, by chance, you missed the headlines, The Verge also has a great 18 minute summary video of all the big stuff announced.",

It will keep the same classic 60’s design, shoot 35mm film, but adds LiDAR-powered autofocus and autoexposure capabilities. I’m thrilled to see more new film cameras coming to market, as it’s my favorite medium for shooting photos. Hopefully, the market will also bring faster, cheaper, and easier ways to develop and scan film negatives to keep up with the increased demand. I, for one, hopped right on the waitlist for this beauty.",

There are some great ones out there—I really like the cases from Peak Design and Moment. That said, I’ve ditched both and am all in on this new Anker case. It’s relatively thin but strong, with a small ring that unfolds for extra grip and rotates to serve as a kickstand in either landscape or portrait orientations. The real win is that you can both do MagSafe charging through the ring and it features extra strong magnets that allow you to attach your phone to any sufficiently metallic surface. I’ve attached mine to the fridge while cooking, to the squat rack while working out, and to an airport rail while waiting for a flight.",

It lets you use natural language input to set a named reminder for a specific date/time, and then it will politely alert you at the appointed time. If you ignore it or dismiss the reminder without marking it “Done,” it will remind you every minute until you do the task or hit a time-specific snooze button (“Snooze for 1 hour,” “Snooze for 1 day,” etc.). It’s fantastic for things you absolutely cannot forget. I have automatic recurring weekly and monthly reminders to take the trash to the curb, do my timesheets, pay my credit card bills, and more. It just hounds me relentlessly until I do them—exactly what I need.",

There are some legitimately cool AI technologies out there, but there are also A LOT of grifters looking to make a quick buck. So it's with that said, I'll note that this week's demo from OpenAI of their new ChatGPT 4o model totally blew my hair back. IF it is as good as it seems (again major caveat emptor), this feels like it could be a massive leap forward for the potential applications of this technology. It's worth watching the short demo to get a sense of some of the possibilities (for good or ill) that this tech can bring. (While the full chat functionality that was demoed won't be out for a few weeks, I've set up my iPhone's action button to open a voice chat with the current generation ChatGPT voice chat, which I'd not really used previously, and have been consistently impressed with it. I'm eager to try out the new version later this month.)",

No distracting voice prompts, etc. My favorite of this pleasant style of meditation aid is still Zenitizer. That said, I had heard positive things about The Way app by Zen Master, Henry Shukman, and decided to give it a try. I've been using it daily for about 2 weeks now as a complement to my regular practice, and have really enjoyed it so far. For me, the stand out feature is that there is a set path of sessions for you to follow-- no decision fatigue figuring exactly which type of guided calm or focus you're looking for in the moment. Instead, this app provides a practical guided course in Zen meditation, with a set curriculum of 10 minute guided lessons every day as you make your way through the course. I appreciate that I not only am getting to sit, but am also learning a new modality for meditation practice as I go. Worth checking out if you're at all curious about meditation, mindfulness, or practical Zen, as the first 30 lessons are free and can be repeated forever.",

FoodNoms has a clean, minimalist design, and makes it crazy easy to track everything from calories to protein, fiber and caffeine regardless of whether you want to cut some pounds, pack on some extra muscle, or just want to get a sense of what you're eating each day. They recently added some cool, AI-powered features that let you get a rough readout on the macronutrients of a meal simply by taking a photo of it and/or describing it.",

This little titanium light is inconceivably lightweight, fits easily in a pocket, and is also small enough to just always have in your EDC bag, purse, fanny pack, etc. I grabbed the version with the traditional Japanese seigaiha pattern on it, which is sold out on Rey's site, but still available at some resellers.",

Even thought it's technically Spring, the sun was doing its best Summer impression while we were out on the beach this last week. I was really impressed that it not only kept me from getting a savage sun burn, but the merino wool woven into the shirt made it dry ridiculously quickly and (most importantly) stay odor free. I brought just two of these shirts and alternated between them each day for 6 days of swimming in the ocean, hiking, and hanging at the bar... Remarkably, neither stink like they should from all the activity and both look clean enough to wear out to brunch.",

Produced by the folks who did Band of Brothers and The Pacific, it tells the story of Allied bomber crews flying during WWII. It's alternately inspiring and grim, but really well done, with excellent production. That said, not sure I recommend watching on flights, like I have-- I guess it depends on your tolerance for seeing planes shot down and crashing while you, yourself are airborne.",

I've seen their earlier knives and liked their simple, affordable take, but I really am digging the 3 iteration of their Lander pocket knife that they are currently Kickstarting. Beyond the great steel, and good looking form factor, I really like the idea of their open sourcing the design so you can tweak and 3D print your own handle scales, etc. I backed it and look forward to putting it to some outdoor use this summer.",

      "description": "We managed to get tickets for a Saturday night showing of Dune II, and 24 hours later I'm still processing everything we saw. It was INTENSE (as the second half of the book was), but I loved it. These two Dune movies are instant classics, and Denis Villeneuve has secured his placed among the best Science Fiction directors/producers of all time. As I wrote in my Letterboxd Review, beyond the epic story, incredible performances, visuals, and costume design, the sound design really blew me away. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack and all the incredible sound work just vibrates you throughout the entire movie. Worth checking out, but I'll warn you that the ending honors the book in not having a fully resolved ending. If anything, these two movies are just teeing up a much larger story. I came home and promptly started reading the sequel to the first Dune book, Dune Messiah, because I can't wait to find out what happens next.",

Many will recall T-Mobile had a similar incident a few months ago. This is just a good opportunity to remind everyone that many common, modern cellphones support multiple eSIM card slots, meaning you can have more than one phone plan / phone number on your phone. I highly recommend getting the cheapest phone/internet plan you can find on another network from your main provider (even if it's just a pre-paid MVNO plan for ~$15/mo) to have as a back-up for outages like this, or even to use when you're road tripping through a dead zone for your normal carrier and really need to make a call or stream some music.",

      "description": "I'm a lighting nerd, and dim, overly yellow bulbs bug the heck out of me. These LED bulbs have been a big hit in our household. They're super bright, have a great CRI, are dimmable, and have a long lifespan. The downside: they cost about $5/bulb. Not cheap, but also cheaper than some other bulbs I've tried out that have not been nearly as impressive.",

At just $399 and big enough to print helmets and other fun cosplay props, this honestly gives the A1 Mini ($299) some healthy competition... I'd say which one you go with really would boil down to your intended use case.

      "description": "I've been using InsightTimer for years to time and track my meditation, but I've not been a fan of their recent turn towards \"premium classes\" and guided meditations. Looking for alternatives, I've come across Zenitizer after asking for suggestions on Mastodon. The developer of Zenitizer was kind enough to reach out after someone else mentioned the app as a good alternative, and made a good pitch for using it. I've only gotten to try it out a few times this week, but so far it's been great if, like me, you're looking for a simple timer with Apple Health integration and some nice options for timing and intervals.",

It's free, and is one of those apps that once you start using, it just completely disappears from your consciousness and becomes muscle memory.

For years, Leica has been the only company in the world making digital rangefinder cameras-- Namely, the lustworthy and wallet-shattering M-series digital bodies. Unbeknownst to me, a small French company called Pixii started producing a very unique digital rangefinder camera body a few years back. What's neat about their offering is it 1) Accepts Leica's glass (all M-mount lenses will work) 2) Its internal hardware is upgradeable as new sensors, processors, and even viewfinders are developed 3) It costs about 1/4 of what a Leica body costs. Lastly, this is not some aspirational Kickstarter project, they have been selling the Pixii since 2018 with a regular stream of internal upgrades being released ever since. The 2023 version (and associated upgrades for older versions) include a 64-bit processor, an advanced Monochrome RAW capture mode, and upgraded Wifi to mobile capabilities. I'm super intrigued.",

So we settled on a Tidbyt. It's a really neat little 32x64 LED pixel display that you can customize the heck out of with various applets from your phone. Beyond running built in weather and clock apps, I've also built custom pixel art greetings for my kiddos each morning featuring drawings I've made of some of their favorite cartoon and video game characters.

Long story short, apparently Instagram’s advertising algorithm also figured out my love for Boba, and I got targeted ads for this Boba Tea Protein powder, which sounds kind of gross, but is actually amazing. I’ve tried both their Matcha Latte and Taro Milk Tea and several of their boba pearl flavors, and am already hooked. I’ve made one a day, everyday this week.

Looking at wins vs losses or times to reach the playoffs, the Mariners are clearly a failure. Such a cursory glance would ignore some of the unequivocally best pitching, batting, and fielding that the sport has ever seen. Such a cursory glance would ignore what it means to be a fan, a leader, and a teammate. \"Dig deeper,\" the producers of this six part video series urge us, \"and you’ll find greatness wherever you look.\" That... combined with arson, toilet jello, face stabbings, and the world’s best timed Nutcracker Suite makes The History of the Seattle Mariners a fascinating, hilarious, heartbreaking watch.",

      "description": "Speaking of retro video games, I just stumbled across the Low Rez Jam, a sort of minimalist video game hackathon that's going on right now. A bunch of teams around the world are competing to make a winning video game playable at 64x64 resolution. Tons of great pixel art and game imagineering going on under the #lowrezjam hashtag on Mastodon (and I presume X, if you're still visiting Elon's vanity project.) The development period wraps up August 15th, and then the games will go up for voting. It will be fun to see and try all the final products.",

      "description": "The preorders opened for this amazing Nintendo / Famicon-inspired keyboard. I have more keyboards than I know what to do with, but I came this close to snagging one of these. Honestly, the only thing that held me back was the very confusing lack of MacOS and iOS support. Holding out hope they do a V2 with support for the superior operating systems.",

The non-traditional animation style, great cast, and killer old school hip-hop sound track make for a great combination. Worth a watch whether you grew up binging the turtles like I did or not.",

      "description": "I’ve been majorly mourning the loss of Apollo and what feels like the Twitter/X-ification of Reddit, so I have been tracking with interest the development of Kbin and Lemmy-based alternatives. There’s still a looong way to go in this space to be a true replacement, but it feels fun to be checking it out while it’s building and growing. Anyway, Hariette released a public TestFlight beta of Artemis, her Kbin client for iOS and Android. It’s early days, but already way more pleasant than the web version of Kbin!",

      "description": "Highly recommended long read for the week, Carrie over on Mastodon surfaced this riveting 2013 article about the North Pond Hermit, who haunted the woods of Central Maine for nearly 30 years, surviving solely via moonlight raids on local cabins and homes to steal junk food and books, not talking to or being seen by another human being for decades. The author tells the amazing tale and then shares his fascinating correspondence with the hermit from jail after he was caught. {There is definitely some sort of comma-related kung-fu I should be using in the preceding sentence that would make it clear that it is the hermit who wound up in jail and not the author, but instead you’re getting this extended parenthetical. Apologies, you deserve better, dear reader.}",
